# EComDB
#### This is meant to be a little interface to a small database (you can put whatever) but I'll be using it to hold electronic component numbers and info. Hopefully will have the ability to search and autocomplete but we will see

layout ideas:
- query input in the top left
- add/update in the bottom left
- right side lists the entire db until query input
    - filters out entries not related to current query
    - automatically updates
    - includes name, type, etc
    - each entry could include a view more button to show the entire entry
